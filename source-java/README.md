The standard approach to implement additional functionality for the Automation Framework is:
* Java code development as Custom Task Template plugin, see [*Custom Task Template Java SDK*](https://blogs.sap.com/2017/12/08/how-to-create-a-custom-task-template-for-bi-automation-framework)
* copy the plugin to your BI platform installation
* deploy the template definition as infoobject to your CMS system database
